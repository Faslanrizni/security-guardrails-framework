# THREAT MODEL - SECURITY RISK ASSESSMENT
# ======================================================================
# 
# PURPOSE OF THIS FILE:
# ---------------------
# This is NOT just documentation - it's the FOUNDATION of your entire
# security framework. Every guardrail exists because of threats listed here.
#
# HOW IT CONNECTS TO GUARDRAILS:
# -----------------------------------
# Guardrail #1 (Contract): Validates this file exists and is complete
# Guardrail #4 (Secrets): Protects assets marked as 'credentials'
# Guardrail #5 (Dependencies): Scans packages that could introduce threats
# Guardrail #6 (SAST): Scans code in affected_components for vulnerabilities
# Guardrail #7 (IaC): Ensures cloud resources protect assets by location

# ======================================================================
# ASSETS - What Are We Protecting?
# ======================================================================
# Why: You can't protect what you don't know exists. This section
#      inventories EVERY valuable thing in your system.
#
# CONNECTION TO GUARDRAILS:
# -------------------------
# - Assets marked as 'credentials' → Guardrail #4 (Secrets) scans for them
# - Assets with location 'database' → Guardrail #7 (IaC) checks encryption
# - Assets with sensitivity 'critical' → Prioritized in all scans
#
# Think of this as your "crown jewels" inventory.
#
# ======================================================================
assets:
  # Each asset is a separate list item with unique ID
  - id: "ASSET-001"
    
    # Why: Human-readable name for the asset
    # Used by: Reports, dashboards, team communication
    name: "Example Data"
    
    # Why: What kind of data is this? Determines compliance requirements
    # Used by: Legal/compliance teams, determines which regulations apply
    # Options:
    # - pci: Payment card data (PCI-DSS compliance required)
    # - pii: Personally Identifiable Information (GDPR/CCPA compliance)
    # - credentials: Passwords, keys, tokens 
    # - internal: Internal business data (standard protection)
    # - public: Intended to be public (least protection)
    type: "pii"
    
    # Why: How bad is it if this asset is compromised?
    # Used by: Prioritizes security controls and incident response
    # Options:
    # - critical: Would cause severe business/financial/legal damage
    # - high: Would cause significant damage
    # - medium: Would cause moderate damage
    # - low: Would cause minor damage
    sensitivity: "high"
    
    # Why: WHERE does this asset live? Physical/logical location
    # Used by: 
    # - Guardrail #7 (IaC): Ensures cloud resources at this location are secure
    # - Incident response: Knows where to look during a breach
    # - Compliance: Auditors verify location security
    # Examples:
    # - "database" - Stored in PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB
    # - "environment variables" - Runtime configuration
    # - "file system" - Files on disk
    # - "cache" - Redis, Memcached
    # - "logs" - Application logs
    # - "backup" - Backup storage
    # - "secrets manager" - Vault, AWS Secrets Manager
    location: "database"
    
    # Why: Detailed explanation of what this asset contains
    # Used by: Anyone who needs to understand the asset without guessing
    description: "Describe the data here"  # Example: "User email addresses, names, and password hashes"

# ======================================================================
# THREATS - How Could Someone Attack?
# ======================================================================
# Why: Identifies specific attack scenarios so we can build defenses
#
# CONNECTION TO GUARDRAILS:
# -------------------------
# - Each threat maps to specific guardrails that prevent it
# - affected_components tells Guardrail #6 (SAST) where to scan
# - mitigations with status 'planned' = security debt to track
#
# Think of this as your "enemy's playbook" - know their moves
# so you can block them.
#
# ======================================================================
threats:
  # Each threat is a separate list item with unique ID
  - id: "THREAT-001"
    
    # Why: Short, descriptive name for the threat
    # Used by: Team communication, reports
    name: "Example Threat"  # Example: "SQL Injection", "Data Leak", "Privilege Escalation"
    
    # Why: Detailed explanation of how the attack works
    # Used by: Developers implementing fixes, security reviewers
    description: "Describe the threat"  # Example: "Attacker injects malicious SQL through unsanitized input fields"
    
    # Why: Categorizes the threat using Microsoft's STRIDE model
    # Used by: Ensures we cover ALL types of threats, not just obvious ones
    # STRIDE Categories:
    # - Spoofing: Impersonating something/someone else
    # - Tampering: Modifying data or code
    # - Repudiation: Denying actions (lack of audit trail)
    # - Information Disclosure: Exposing data to unauthorized parties
    # - Denial of Service: Making system unavailable
    # - Elevation of Privilege: Gaining unauthorized access
    # 
    # Why this matters: If you have no threats in "Denial of Service",
    #                    you might be missing DDoS protection!
    stride_category: "Tampering"
    
    # Why: Which parts of your system are vulnerable to this threat?
    # Used by: 
    # - Guardrail #6 (SAST): Scans these components for vulnerabilities
    # - Guardrail #5 (Dependencies): Checks packages used by these components
    # - Incident response: Knows which services to check during an attack
    # 
    # Common values (match your code structure):
    # - "api" - REST/gRPC endpoints
    # - "database" - Data storage layer
    # - "auth" - Authentication service
    # - "frontend" - UI/Client code
    # - "worker" - Background jobs
    # - "cache" - Caching layer
    # - "file_storage" - File uploads
    # - "third_party" - External services
    affected_components: ["api", "database"]
    
    # ==================================================================
    # MITIGATIONS - How Do We Prevent This?
    # ==================================================================
    # Why: Every threat MUST have at least one mitigation. If not,
    #      you're accepting the risk (should be documented exception).
    #
    # CONNECTION TO GUARDRAILS:
    # -------------------------
    # - Each mitigation maps to ONE OR MORE guardrails
    # - Example: "Input Validation" mitigation → Guardrail #6 (SAST)
    # - Example: "Encryption" mitigation → Guardrail #7 (IaC)
    # - Example: "No hardcoded secrets" → Guardrail #4 (Secrets)
    #
    # Think of mitigations as your "shields" against each attack.
    #
    # ==================================================================
    mitigations:
      # Each mitigation is a separate list item with unique ID
      - id: "MIT-001"
        
        # Why: Short name for the protection measure
        name: "Input Validation"
        
        # Why: Detailed explanation of how this prevents the threat
        description: "Validate all user input for type, length, format, and range"
        
        # Why: What's the implementation status?
        # Used by: 
        # - Guardrail #1: Can warn about unmitigated threats
        # - Security metrics: Track progress over time
        # - Auditors: Verify controls are in place
        # Options:
        # - "planned": We know we need it, not started (security debt)
        # - "implemented": Code is written and deployed
        # - "verified": Tested and confirmed effective
        status: "planned"
        
        # Why: Who is responsible for implementing/fixing this?
        # Used by: 
        # - Pull request reviews (security-owners.yaml)
        # - Accountability tracking
        # Format: Use team names that match security-owners.yaml
        owner: "team-name"  # Example: "backend-team", "security-team", "platform-team"
        
        # Why: When must this be done by?
        # Used by: 
        # - Project planning
        # - Security debt tracking
        # - Guardrail #1 can warn about overdue mitigations
        # Format: YYYY-MM-DD

# ======================================================================
# HOW TO USE THIS FILE
# ======================================================================
#
# 1. START WITH ASSETS:
#    - List EVERY piece of valuable data in your system
#    - Be specific about locations and sensitivity
#    - This drives everything else
#
# 2. BRAINSTORM THREATS:
#    - For each asset, ask "How could this be compromised?"
#    - Use STRIDE to ensure you cover all angles
#    - Don't worry about mitigations yet
#
# 3. ADD MITIGATIONS:
#    - For each threat, list at least one control
#    - Map to existing guardrails where possible
#    - Track 'planned' items as security debt
#
# 4. REVIEW REGULARLY:
#    - Update last_reviewed date
#    - Add new threats as system evolves
#    - Update status of mitigations
#
# 5. CONNECT TO GUARDRAILS:
#    - Ensure every threat is covered by at least one guardrail
#    - If a threat has no guardrail → You need a new guardrail!
#    - If a guardrail doesn't map to any threat → Is it necessary?
